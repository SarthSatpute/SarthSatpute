# Hey, I’m Sarth 👋  
This is my little digital dumping ground where side-projects, hackathon chaos, and “accidental” good ideas coexist.  

Fueled mostly by coffee and curiosity (with a sprinkle of panic before deadlines), I’ve somehow ended up building everything from agent frameworks and AI dashboards to Android remote-control hacks and ship load optimization algorithms. Python and Generative AI are my comfort zone, while frontends… let’s just say we’re frenemies at best.  

My code tries to stay clean (the desk, not so much), and my GitHub is basically a gallery of experiments—some brilliant, some questionable, all very *me*. Outside the code, I’m usually running hackathons, helping my clubs survive deadlines, or convincing myself that my book stack will read itself.  

When I’m not debugging, I’m riding, binging, or pretending I totally have this “productivity” thing under control.  

⚠️ **Warning:** May contain traces of ambition disguised as competence.
